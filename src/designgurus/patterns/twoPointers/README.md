The two pointers pattern is a common pattern to use in DSA problems whenever the following conditions re met:
- We have a sorted array or list
- We want to find groups of numbers (Pair, triplet, etc) that meet a certain condition

We usually put one of the pointers at the beginning, and another at the end.
